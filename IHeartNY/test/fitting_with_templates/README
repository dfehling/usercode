To run some of the code in this directory, you will need lichen and iminuit. 

* iminuit is a python wrapper to the MINUIT minimization code.

https://github.com/iminuit/iminuit

    git clone https://github.com/iminuit/iminuit
    cd iminuit
    python setup.py install # May need to run this as root/sudo, depending on your setup.


* lichen is a set of functions that enable easier use of matplotlib and iminuit.

    git clone https://github.com/mattbellis/lichen
    cd lichen
    python setup.py install # May need to run this as root/sudo, depending on your setup.

################
# CMSDAS fit
################

This is the code that was actually used at the 2013 CMSDAS. We used data
prepared for the school drawm from 5 ifb from the 8 TeV dataset and fit
to the secondary vertex mass distribution. 

*************************************************************************
This code uses ROOT and Roofit, making use of the PyROOT implementation.

It has been tested with ROOT 5.34, and does not make use of any CMSSW
specific code or libraries.
*************************************************************************

We used binned templates drawn from the ROOT files produced by other scripts
developed by the participants. The filenames and histograms from which the
binned templates are drawn are hardcoded in the fitting script:

    fit_from_CMSDAS_2013.py

The ROOT files are in 

    CMSDAS_root_files/*skim_plots.root

The fitting script looks in these files for a histogram named

    secvtxMass_btag_maxpt_njets4

and uses this histogram for the fit templates as well as the data 
to fit to.

To run, simply type

    python fit_from_CMSDAS_2013.py

###################################################
# iminuit version of CMSDAS fit
###################################################

This is a version of the CMSDAS code, written to be independent of ROOT.
Instead, it uses iminuit and codes up the likelihood function
and any uncertainty calculations by hand. 

    fit_iminuit_version_of_CMSDAS_2013.py

The binned templates can be found in 

    templates_for_iminuit_fit_CMSDAS

as text files named

    output_<MC process/data>_njets<#>.dat

These text files are two columns: the center of the histogram bin in 
the first column and the occupancy (height) of that bin in the second 
column. These files were actually produced from the ROOT files used
at CMSDAS. The names of these files are hardcoded in the fitting
script.

To run, just type

    python fit_iminuit_version_of_CMSDAS_2013.py
