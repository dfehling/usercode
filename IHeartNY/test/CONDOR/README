*** instructions for running batch jobs on condor *** 

If you have an updated version of the iheartNY script, you need to:
(1) copy it to the tardir/ folder
(2) go to tardir/ folder and recreate the tarball (tar czvf tarball.tgz *), and copy that to the CONDOR/ directory

The various files "listofjobs_..." have been generated from executing:  python run_pdfs_...py > listofjobs_...

To actually submit jobs, first create these "commands_..." files which has the right format of what's to be submitted, do e.g.: 

./runManySections.py --createCommandFile --cmssw --addLog --setTarball=tarball.tgz  listofjobs_CT10_mu commands_CT10_mu

Then submit as e.g.: 

./runManySections.py --submitCondor commands_CT10_mu

*** histogram files for theta vs postfit ones for unfolding? *** 

In run_iheartny.py (for non-ttbar MC) / run_iheartny_unfold.py (for ttbar MC), there is an option to set postfit=True / False.
