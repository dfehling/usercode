for $PTMIN < \pt^{AVG} < PTMAX$ \GeVc. The data are shown in black
points. 
STATSTRING
The simulated distribution from \PYTHIA is shown in solid black, 
the from \PYTHIAEIGHT in dashed red, and from \HERWIG in dotted blue. 
The bottom frame shows the ratio of the true distribution from
the simulation divided by the unfolded distribution, along with
the uncertainties in the unfolded distribution.
